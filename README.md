# Engineering-Faculty-Data-Visualization-Project
A semester-long research project using R to perform data analysis and visualization on data from historical texts

As part of my 'Blueprint for Modernity' coursework (an NSF grant-funded course), I conducted an original research project on the history of engineering.

I used R and RStudio to import, clean, and format the data into a usable database. 

I then used a couple of different visualization libraries (ggplot2, ggplotly, streamgraph) to create multiple visualizations for data storytelling.

The 30-page final report, including historical context, is not included here, obviously...just the R code!
